# Intrusion_Detection_RNN_ANN
DETECTION OF NETWORK ATTACK USING NEURAL NETWORK

In this project, a new approach to classify normal and various attack patterns through the use of Neural Network based on Intrusion Detection is introduced. The Proposed methods presents two existing types of neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network) and using various performance indicators (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, true positive rate, false positive rate), their results and performances are compared. Unlike most literature, a series of comprehensive experiments were performed for the identification of the optimal parameters, it took into account the number of epochs, type of optimization function, the number of neurons and the loss function for the neural networks.
Based on the KDD-Cup dataset, a four layer recurrent neural network-Long Short Term Memory was used successfully for the classification of attack records. Although, the classification results were slightly better in the two layer Artificial Neural Network-Multi-Layer Perceptron.
